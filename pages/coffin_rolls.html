    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My Empty Coffin Rolls (aka Hocus Pocus Buns) are a new tradition in my home and have quickly become a family favorite. These delicious rolls have a disappearing marshmallow and are perfect for a magical Halloween treat. Plus I have a secret tip to help keep the rolls together while baking.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) package jumbo refrigerated crescent rolls</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>8 large marshmallows</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Prepare muffin pan (preferably jumbo muffin pan) with non-stick cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Separate rolls into eight triangles and set aside. Combine sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Dip each marshmallow into butter, then roll in cinnamon-sugar and place on a triangle dough. Pinch dough around marshmallow, sealing all edges. Make sure to seal well or all the marshmallow will escape.</li>
        <li>Dip tops of dough into the remaining butter and then into the cinnamon-sugar. Place roll with the sugar side up into prepared muffin cups.</li>
        <li>Bake at 375 degrees for 13 - 15 minutes. Eat warm.</li>
    </ol>
